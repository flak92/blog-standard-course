This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project made with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


## IMPORTANT FOR VERSION MADE AFTER ALFATRAINING COURSE !!! (THIS VERSION).

This Project is a version from Pawel Flak (Course member at "Javascript - Ajax Course" by Alfatraining GmbH in Germany) made so near how it's possible to be commercial (Usable), because Course-member is searching for a Job.

That's why it's needed to create/have accounts by:
- "auth0" login solutions provider,
- "MongoDB" (Database Provider)
- "OpenAi" (AI Solutions Provider).

[Auth0](https://https://auth0.com/)
[MongoDB](https://https://www.mongodb.com/)
[OpenAI](https://https://openai.com/)

! ! ! On start you must paste your api-keys to ".env.local" ("use .env.local.sample") file ! ! ! 

1. You need auth0 account to have the possibility to login in the App. (Or remove parts with "withPageAuthRequired" function). 
2. You must create or connect to existing MongoDB Cluster with name "BlogStandard" and two collections "users" & "posts".
3. You must Create an account on OpenAI and have there Tokens to buy computing power.

Then Get Started !!! 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
